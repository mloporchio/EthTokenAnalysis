# EthTokenAnalysis

This repository contains code for reproducing the results presented in the paper "Analysis and Characterization of ERC-20 Token Network Topologies" by Matteo Loporchio, Damiano Di Francesco Maesa, Anna Bernasconi, and Laura Ricci. 

The paper examines ERC-20 token networks, where nodes represent users and edges correspond to token transfers. The analysis focuses on the 100 largest ERC-20 networks, studying their key topological properties and the temporal evolution of transfers. The article also includes an analysis based on clustering methods to determine whether ERC-20 contracts with the same application domain induce networks with similar topological features. 

# Dataset

All code has been developed to analyze ERC-20 token transfer data available in <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10644077">this repository</a>.
